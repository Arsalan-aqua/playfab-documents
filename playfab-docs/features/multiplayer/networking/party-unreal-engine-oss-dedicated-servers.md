# Dedicated Server Setup Guide

This guide is to help you set up and prepare your game to use dedicated servers alongside the PlayFab OnlineSubsystem.

## Prerequisites
- A base-level understanding of how [Unreal Engine's Dedicated Server](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/setting-up-dedicated-servers-in-unreal-engine/) model works.
- An "client" PC you can use as a connecting client for your game.
- A "server" PC you can use as a hosting server for your game.
  - A second PC is recommended, but you may use the same one, VM instance, or Docker instance if you'd prefer. This quickstart guide will walk you through setup with a second PC.

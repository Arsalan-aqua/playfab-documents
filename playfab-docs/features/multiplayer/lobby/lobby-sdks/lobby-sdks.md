This topic describes all the Azure PlayFab Lobby and Matchmaking SDKs that are currently available.

Access to SDKs for PC(Win32), Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PC (GDK), and Xbox (GDK) requires special approval and adherence to platform policies. For more information, see [Request access for SDKs and samples](../../networking/request-access-for-sdks-samples.md).

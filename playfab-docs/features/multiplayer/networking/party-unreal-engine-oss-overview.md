# Overview

The PlayFab Party Online Subsystem (PFP OSS) enables you to make use of Party and Azure Cognitive services in your Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) game. This includes cross-talk, cross-play, accessibility features like real-time text chat translation and voice transcription services. It is currently designed for use when developing PC and Xbox games. This subsystem layer works seamlessly on top of the existing Epic provided base Online Subsystem (OSS) GDK / Live for Xbox Live. PlayFab Party OSS compliments the base OSS by adding support for PlayFab Party networking and Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP).

Party OSS works alongside the PlayFab SDK marketplace plugin which provides other PlayFab functionalities such as economy, leaderboards, and more. For more information, see [PlayFab SDK on the UE4 Marketplace (external site)](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/product/playfab-sdk).

## Which versions of Unreal Engine are supported?
We recommend using Unreal Engine 4.25plus â€“ the first approved version of UE4 for shipping on the Microsoft GDK. If you are on an earlier version of Unreal Engine 4, the OSS can be backported with minimal work. Refer to the [Using older versions of Unreal Engine 4](party-unreal-engine-using-older-versions.md) page for more details.

**NOTE:** If you are using a version of UE4 earlier than 4.25plus, you will have to rename all references to GDK to Anvil using find & replace all.

- **PC**
    - Recommended: June 2020 GDK (2006) or later

        - When utilizing a GDK version earlier than 2006 on PC, please reach out to your Microsoft Representative for further guidance.

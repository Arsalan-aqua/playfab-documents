# Quickstart for multiplayer servers (API/PowerShell)

This tutorial helps you quickly upload a sample multiplayer server, configure a server build, and create server instances.

On a Windows 10 PC, get the following prerequisites ready:

- A PlayFab title ID - this needs to be a title that PlayFab has authorized for the private preview.
- A developer secret key for the title. For more information about secret keys, see [Secret key management](../../../gamemanager/secret-key-management.md)..
- [Game Server SDK Sample - Windows Runner](https://github.com/PlayFab/gsdkSamples/releases/)

## Install the PlayFab Multiplayer PowerShell module

1. Install the [PlayFab Multiplayer PowerShell module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PlayFabMultiplayer) by opening a Windows Powershell window as Administrator and run the command:

```powershell
Install-Module PlayFabMultiplayer
```

2. You can learn more about the cmdlets in the PlayFab Multiplayer PowerShell module by running the following command.

```powershell
Get-Command -Module PlayFabMultiplayer| Get-Help
```

## Enable multiplayer servers for your title

In the **PowerShell** window, run the following command using your title ID and associated developer key:

```powershell
Set-PFTitle -TitleID "mytitleID" -secretkey "mysecretkey"
```

This command uses the [PlayFab C# SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PlayFabAllSDK/) to call [GetEntityToken](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.authentication.authentication.getentitytoken). Now let's [enable multiplayer servers](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.multiplayer.multiplayerserver.enablemultiplayerserversfortitle) for the title:

```powershell
Enable-PFMultiplayerServer
```

## Upload a game server executable as an asset

We're going to use the *managed containers* option to create a build. With managed containers, your game server build is created by uploading assets that are combined with a Windows container image. For this tutorial, upload the `winrunnerSample.zip` folder from the sample servers package you downloaded earlier

```powershell
Add-PFMultiplayerAsset -FilePath "C:\windowsSample.zip"
```

### Create a build

Now that the asset is uploaded, we can create a build.

```powershell  
$VMSelection = [PlayFab.MultiplayerModels.AzureVMSize]::Standard_D2_v2

$Ports = New-object PlayFab.MultiplayerModels.Port
$Ports.Name = "game_port"
$Ports.Num = 3600
$Ports.Protocol = [PlayFab.MultiplayerModels.ProtocolType]::TCP

$Regions = New-object PlayFab.MultiplayerModels.BuildRegionParams
$Regions.MaxServers = 1
$Regions.Region = "EastUS"
$Regions.StandbyServers = 1

$Asset = New-object PlayFab.MultiplayerModels.AssetReferenceParams
$Asset.FileName = "windowsSample.zip"
$Asset.MountPath = "C:\Assets"

New-PFMultiplayerBuild -BuildName "PSTest_build"  -StartMultiplayerServerCommand "C:\Assets\WindowsRunnerCSharp.exe" -Ports $Ports -VMSize $VMSelection -AssetReferences $Asset -MultiplayerServerCountPerVm 1 -RegionConfiguration $Regions
```

In a few seconds we should see the build through the **PowerShell** or [ListBuildSummaries API](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.multiplayer.multiplayerserver.listbuildsummariesv2), as shown below.

```powershell
Get-PFMultiplayerBuild -All
```
### Formatting the game start command

The StartMultiplayerServerCommand property is a required input to the Multiplayer Server [Create Build](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.multiplayer.multiplayerserver.createbuildwithmanagedcontainer) API's. PlayFab Multiplayer Server leverages Azure Docker to secure and manage enterprise container apps in the cloud. Multiplayer Servers docker containers use PowerShell as the entry point for starting game server builds but has strict formatting rules to function correctly. For example:

``PS D:\> Write-Host -arg1=alpha.beta -arg2=alpha.beta``

Due to way that PowerShell processes the command line, the preceding command fails when run. The arguments are separated into '-arg1=alpha.' and 'beta'. To format the command correctly, wrap the game start command into quotes as follows:

``PS D:\> Write-Host "-arg1=alpha.beta -arg2=alpha.beta"``

An alternative solution is to use double dashes (--) instead of a single dash to specify the arguments. For example:

``PS D:\> Write-Host --arg1=alpha.beta --arg2=alpha.beta``

### Request a multiplayer server

Now that we've got a build, lets see standing by servers get created.

```powershell
Get-PFMultiplayerServer
```

Once we see some standing by servers, let's request one for gameplay...

```powershell
$Regions = new-object 'System.Collections.Generic.List[PlayFab.MultiplayerModels.AzureRegion]'
$Regions.Add("EastUS");

$svr = New-PFMultiplayerServer -BuildName "PSTest_build" -SessionId "3bb5351f-363c-48f4-ba37-d14c12872fbc" -SessionCookie "test cookie" -PreferredRegions $Regions
```

This is the core of PlayFab multiplayer servers: within 3 seconds of your matchmaking service calling [RequestMultiplayerServer](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.multiplayer.multiplayerserver.requestmultiplayerserver), PlayFab will allocate a new server.

These servers come from continuously refilled, standing-by server pools you configure on a per-region and per-build basis. After gameplay ends the server is recycled.

### Configure regional settings

To tune the number of standing-by servers and regional allocation, the portal might be simpler to use than the APIs.

In Game Manager, you should see a **Multiplayer** tab and your builds listed under **Servers 2.0**, as shown below.

![Game Manager - Thunderhead Table](media/tutorials/game-manager-thunderhead-table.png)

Select the title of a build to navigate to it's regional configuration, as seen here.

![Region Simple Input](media/tutorials/region-simple-input.png)

From this point you can add more regions, modify standing-by targets, and regional maximums.

# Request access for Azure PlayFab Party SDKs and samples

This topic provides information about how you can access Azure PlayFab Party SDKs and samples for **Nintendo Switch**, **PlayStation 4**, **PlayStation 5**, **Google Stadia**, **PC (GDK)**, and **Xbox (GDK)**.

Adhering to platform policies, we need to ensure that you're a registered developer before granting access, so a few extra steps are required from you. For example, you need to be a registered Switch developer to get access to Party SDKs and samples for Switch.

>[!NOTE]
>For other platforms, operating systems, and frameworks, you don't have to request for access to start using Party SDKs and samples.

If you're not yet a registered developer for the previously mentioned platforms and want to become one, go to their developer page to learn more. To become a registered developer for Xbox and PC, go to [ID@Xbox](https://www.xbox.com/Developers/id).

## Switch and PlayStation

### Switch and PS4

1. Go to the Nintendo/Sony developer portal, and then find our page (categorized under Middleware).
1. Follow the instructions there. Use their site to send us a notification to let us know that you're a registered developer.

### PS5

1. Go to the Sony developer portal. Open a ticket with their support team.
1. In the ticket, state that you would like to use PlayFab services. Ask them to let us know that youâ€™re a registered PS5 developer.

## Stadia

1. Email PlayFabSdkAccess@microsoft.com with your developer information.
1. After we've verified that you're a registered developer for Stadia, we'll grant you access.

## PC (GDK) and Xbox (GDK)

If you're a registered developer but don't yet have access, email your Microsoft representative.

## Need help?

If you have more questions, post them on [PlayFab forums](https://community.playfab.com/index.html) or directly contact developer support for Nintendo, Sony, Google, or Xbox.

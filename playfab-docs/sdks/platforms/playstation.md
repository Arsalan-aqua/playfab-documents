# PlayFab Services SDKs for Sony PlayStation&#174;

The following SDKs are available for game client development on Sony PlayStation. The right SDK depends mostly on your choice of game engine.

| PlayFab SDK    | Description | Learn More |
|----------------|-------------|------------|
| Unreal         | An Unreal Engine marketplace plugin designed for use with either C++ or blueprint. | [Unreal SDK Overview](../unreal/index.md) |
| Unity          | Both an editor extension and stand-alone SDK for Unity3d. | [Unity SDK Overview](../unity3d/index.md) |
| Legacy C++     | Our older cross-platform C++ SDK supports a simple REST-like interface with PlayFab across multiple platforms. | [Request Access](../../features/multiplayer/networking/request-access-for-sdks-samples.md) |

## Getting Access to SDKs for Sony PlayStation;

Our PlayFab Services SDKs for Unreal and Unity are platform-agnostic. As such, they require no special access or permissions from PlayFab to utilize on any platform.

To utilize our Legacy C++ SDK on PlayStation (either PS4&#8482; or PS5&#8482;), you must get middleware approval from Sony. Once you have approval, we can grant access to the SDK. Learn more about this process here: [Request Access](../../features/multiplayer/networking/request-access-for-sdks-samples.md).

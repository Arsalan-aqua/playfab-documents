# Title Launches
Customers can upgrade their account plan and launch titles using the self-service upgrade and launch experiences found in Game Manager.

## Title Modes
A PlayFab title has two possible modes:
1. **DEVELOPMENT MODE :** A Development title has no cost to the customer. Use Development mode to experiment with most PlayFab offerings. A title in development mode is subject to the specific player count and meter usage limits determined by PlayFab. For more information about included limits, see [development mode](../pricing/Development-Mode.md).
2. **LIVE MODE :** A live title is charged to the customer on a Pay-as-you-Go basis. Any meter usage over what is included in the account plan's base rate results in charges per meter consumed. For more information, see [Meters](../pricing/Meters/meters.md).

## Launching a title

> [!WARNING]
> Launching a title is a permanent action. The title cannot return to Development mode after the launch is completed.

To be eligible for launch, a title must be linked to a Studio with a paid account plan.

### Launching a Title within a Free Account Plan
Titles may only be launched within Studios owned by paid accounts.Follow the steps listed under Upgrading from Free to Standard to launch a title in conjunction with upgrading an account.

### Launching a Title within a Paid Account Plan
To launch a title within a paid account plan:

1. Log in to [PlayFab.com](https://playfab.com/)

2. Navigate to the **My Studios** page and identify the **Development Mode** title to be launched (2).

3. Select the down arrow on the title to open the drop-down menu (2).

4. From the drop down, select **Launch Title**. 

5. If the title is linked to a free account plan, **Launch Title** takes you to the account upgrade flow described in the **Upgrading from Free to Standard** section. If the title is linked to a paid account, continue to the next step.

6. A pop-up will prompt you to confirm the title launch. Once **Launch Title** is selected, the launch is complete and the title is no longer bound by [Development Mode](../pricing/Development-Mode.md) limits.

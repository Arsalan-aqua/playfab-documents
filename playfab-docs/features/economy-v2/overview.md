# Economy v2.0 overview

[!INCLUDE [notice](../../includes/_economy-release.md)]

Economy v2 is a major change from the existing PlayFab Monetization suite of features, and the goal of the change is to support titles with hundreds of millions of active players, large progression systems, and giant inventories. The architecture has been rebuilt on the modern Azure Stack from the ground up, and it targets developers' needs related to the following:

* Idempotent transactions
* Batch operations
* Handling of high [concurrency](catalog/etags.md) rates, especially with inventory interactions
* Large unified catalog (unlimited number of items) of in-game goods or UGC  
* Individual Catalog Item documents instead of all items being stored in a single document
* Large player inventories ([3,000+ items](catalog/limits.md))
* Integration with PlayFab Entities

Economy v2 is designed with the same flexibility and extensibility that you would expect from other PlayFab services. Although the architecture is new to PlayFab, it's battle-tested and it supports internal Microsoft titles, such as **Minecraft**, **Sea of Thieves**, and **Flight Simulator**.

## Which version of Economy should I use?

You should use version 2, and if you're on version 1, you should look at upgrading. Although we are _not_ deprecating v1 and will maintain and support it for all titles, it's in bugfix-only mode; also, new Economy features are being developed only for version 2. Take a look at our [FAQ](faq.md) for more information on the differences between the two versions.

## Changes in key features

Features of Economy that were too restrictive to be useful didn't make the cut to v2. To remediate this, we launched Azure Functions as an enhanced successor to CloudScript, and we have provided recipe-style documentation as a starting point for your own custom implementations. We then focused our efforts on what you told us was most important.

The following v1 features arenâ€™t included in Economy v2:

* Trading (see the [Roadmap](../../roadmap/index.md))
* Converting items  
* Limited items
* Drop tables
* Containers
* Recharge rates
* Store support for segments

Economy v2 brings new useful features:

* Updated interactions between the [inventory](inventory/index.md) and catalog allow you to support unique items, non-unique items, stacks of items, and multiple stacks of items.
* Catalog items have [metadata](catalog/content-types-tags-and-properties.md) as well as content that can be uploaded and managed alongside your catalog; this includes images and files.
* [Deep links](catalog/deep-links.md) to game content can now be created using the economy settings.
* Customizable [catalog search](catalog/search.md) allows you to set up custom views with tags and content types.
* There is now a simple way to [localize](catalog/localization.md) item descriptions and titles.
* There are now APIs that support PlayerEntity-facing [Item Ratings and Reviews](catalog/ratings.md).
* There is now support for custom workflow in [authoring with draft states](catalog/item-status.md) and [policy permissions sets for catalog admins and reviewers](settings.md). You can pre-publish catalog items with a future start date.
* There are now [bundle items](bundles.md) that can be linked to multiple external marketplace items.

Python is a general purpose scripting language that is great for automation and server-side coding. Our Python SDK is compatible with Python 3, and provides everything you need to access the PlayFab API.

You will need Python 3 installed on your machine to use this SDK.

This SDK was last auto-generated using the [SDKGenerator](https://docs.microsoft.com/gaming/playfab/sdks/sdkgenerator/)&mdash;an open-sourcedÂ tool developed by us.

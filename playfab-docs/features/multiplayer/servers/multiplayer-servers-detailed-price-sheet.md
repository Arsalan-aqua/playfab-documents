# Multiplayer servers - detailed price sheet

PlayFab multiplayer servers operate on most generally available Azure virtual machine sizes and regions. These are the most popular series for game developers providing progressively faster processors:

- The Av2-series VMs can be deployed on a variety of hardware types and processors. The size is throttled, based upon the hardware, to offer consistent processor performance for the running instance, regardless of the hardware it is deployed on.
- The Dv2-series VMs features a  powerful CPU and optimal CPU-to-memory configuration making them suitable for most production workloads. The Dv2-series is about 35% faster than the D-series. Dv2-series runs on the Intel® Xeon® 8171M 2.1GHz (Skylake), Intel® Xeon® E5-2673 v4 2.3 GHz (Broadwell), or the Intel® Xeon® E5-2673 v3 2.4 GHz (Haswell) processors with the Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0.
- The Fsv2-series is based on the Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8168 processor. It features a sustained all core Turbo clock speed of 3.4 GHz and a maximum single-core turbo frequency of 3.7 GHz. Intel® AVX-512 instructions are new on Intel Scalable Processors. These instructions provide up to a 2X performance boost to vector processing workloads on both single and double precision floating point operations. In other words, they're really fast for any computational workload. At a lower per-hour list price, the Fsv2-series is the best value in price-performance in the Azure portfolio based on the Azure Compute Unit (ACU) per vCPU.

Unless otherwise specified, the price for a virtual machine is proportional to the number of virtual CPUs and their type. For example, a 4-core virtual machine from the Dv3 series will cost twice as much as a 2-core virtual machine.

> The following prices are *per virtual machine compute hour*.
